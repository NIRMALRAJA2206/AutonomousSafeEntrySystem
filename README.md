# BARI-DEFENDO  AutonomousSafeEntrySystem
## Description: 
Coronavirus (COVID-19) is an infectious and deadly disease that made the whole world shut down. But there exist some mandatory needs where people have to get out of their homes. As it's said, prevention is always better than the cause. This pandemic made us realize the value of being responsible to prevent diseases. To ensure this, the government has laid certain rules to follow, like wearing a mask, checking temperature, and sanitizing periodically, and maintain social distancing. These plans are done manually at the shops and public places. But still, we can see people violating these rules. So, we have taken this as our problem statement and have come up with a solution. Our proposed work is designed in a way that we will be placing a barricade at the entrance and it will open only if the person is wearing a mask and if his temperature is normal. If the two conditions are satisfied, the automatic sanitizing system will allow the person to sanitize. Only after these three procedures, the barricade will move. Some places have restrictions to accommodate only a certain number of people. In such cases, the count will be calculated, and if the place is full the barricade will not open until the count gets reduced. We make this possible by using AI technology for mask detection, human detection and by installing sensors like temperature sensors. And in addition to it, we will be adding a vending machine for people who don't have masks with them and an add-on feature to indicate the owner if the sanitizer level gets low
##Software requirements:
Python libraries such as Opencv, TensorFlow and Deeplearning for Mask detection. Tinkercad for stimulation purpose
Arduino IDE software, Rasberry pi software
##Hardware requirements:
DC motors, ip camera, Rasberry pi, temperature sensor, IR sensor, ultra sonic sensor, GSM module, Arduino, pump.

##Process flow
1) Population density
Determines the count of people. 
2) Body temperature
Determines the temperature of the body.
3) Mask
Detects if person wears a mask or not.
4) Sanitization
Sanitize the person automatically
